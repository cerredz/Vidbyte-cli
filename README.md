The terminal client for Vidbyte: run research threads, Vidbyte's specialized agents, and local
runtime primitives from your shell. Every command can emit JSON, so coding agents can drive it too.

> This repository is the CLI's public home: install instructions, releases, and the issue
> tracker. The package itself is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/vidbyte-cli/).

## Install

Requires Python 3.11 or newer.

```bash
pipx install vidbyte-cli                    # a global command in its own environment
python -m pip install vidbyte-cli           # or: into an activated virtual environment
vidbyte-cli --help
```

Upgrade with `pipx upgrade vidbyte-cli` or `python -m pip install -U vidbyte-cli`.

## Quickstart

```bash
vidbyte-cli login                           # store your Vidbyte API key
vidbyte-cli doctor                          # check configuration and credentials
vidbyte-cli research start "your question"  # open a research thread
vidbyte-cli research threads                # list your threads
```
